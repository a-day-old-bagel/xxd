# xxd - Hexdump utility #

This is a clone of Juergen Weigert's hexdump utility, `xxd`.
To use, just run `make`, and an executable will be compiled.

This fork, however, also provides CMake support for both the executable
and a static lib version, for integration into larger CMake projects.

## Probably the real license ##

As per https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2015/01/msg00037.html,
I believe that xxd is released under
X11-MIT or GPL-2.0 (at the user's choice).
I saved a copy of the web page I linked to as DeducedLicense.html.

Of course, you probably still want explicit written consent from
the author or something just to make sure. Don't take my word for it.
